*Somewhere in the Indian Ocean, 1723. The Golden Age of Piracy.*

When a zombie apocalypse threatens his wench, his crew, and his way of life, pirate Captain Piro is forced to pick up his hook and defend against surges of fiends he once called legends. Suffer the grueling fight for survival across land and sea, as Piro works to plunder a new world, one hell-beast at a time. 

## How to Play
